## Chapter One: A Pragmatic Philosophy

### Summary
This first chapter discussed what the pragmatic philosophy is, basically prefacing the mentality behind solid coding practices. A lot of what the pragmatic philosophy is has many similarities to what it means to be a solid worker in any field, prioritizing critical thinking, communication, and pride in your craft. On the other hand, it also gives many unique pieces of advice that apply directly to programming such as its theory on software entropy and how one sloppy line can create a careless mentality which will spread to an entire project. 

### It's Your Life
> I'm not in this world to live up to your expectations and you're not in this world to live up to mine.

The main theme in this section is that as programmers, we have a lot of agency. If our enviornment sucks, we need to take responsibility for that and make a change. We work in a field with a seemingly unlimited amount of paths and options, so use it to your advantage to create an amazing career for yourself.

### The Cat Ate My Source Code
> The greatest of all weaknesses is the fear of appearing weak.

Take responsibility for your work! It is paramount to have honor in what your do and take charge of your own career. Promote trust in your team, provide options without lame excuses, if you don't know then find out.

### Software Entropy
This is an interesting section. It talks about the idea of "software rot" and how a project full of well-written beautiful code can decay into chaos as a single sloppy line can spread like a disease. 

The authors make an interesting parallel to a study done on inner-city areas where a single broken window creates a feeling of abondonment and becomes a catalyst for communal decline. In coding, it is important that if a window breaks, we fix it and keep good practice throughout a project.

### Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs
I particularly like this section, as it includes a parable which I felt deeply connected to; the three soldiers and stone soup. In the story, three soldiers bring a scared community out of their homes to make a tasty soup by simply starting with some stones in a pot. This reminded me of a quote I heard relating to writer's block, being, "All you have to do is start." This is so true! Sometimes we don't feel the motivation to put in the work on a project, but simple even unrelated tasks can give us the momentum to get back on the horse.

Other thoughts in the chapter include being a catalyst for change, rally people by showing them a glimpse of the future, and remember the big picture to avoid tangents that slowly "boil the frog" and kill the project. 

### Good-Enough Software
> Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.

Writing good enough software does not mean to imply poorly written code to help timelines. What it really means is to include users in your production as to stay on track with producing what they need. It is easy to spend 100 hours creating a feature that no one wants, so make sure your putting effort into the right areas before adding on luxury features. 

### Your Knowledge Portfolio
> An invenstment in knowledge always pays the best interest. 

This is an important section as it emphasizes the importance of constantly learning new things. It draws an interesting parallel to investing in a finantial portfolio with tips we should follow closely:
- Serious investors invest regularly-as a habit.
- Diversification is the key to long-term success.
- Smart investors balance their portfolios between conservative and high-risk, high-reward investments.
- Investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum return.
- Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically.

It then gives some additional advice:
- Learn at least one new language every year
- Read a technical book each month
- Read nontechnical books, too
- Take classes
- Participate in local user groups
- Experiment with different environments
- Stay current

Lastly, this section puts a big emphasis on critical thinking and asking the "Five Whys" to properly assess information. 

### Communicate!
> I believe that it is better to be looked over than it is to be overlooked.

Communication is just as important as the programming itself, and being good communicators is a big part of what sets apart the craftsmen from the script-kiddies.

There are a few concepts in this section that outline the most significant factors of communication, being:
- Know what you want to say.
- Know your audience. 
- Choose your moment. 
- Choose a style.
- Make it look good.
- Involve your audience.
- Be a listener.
- Get back to people.
- Keep code and documentation together.
